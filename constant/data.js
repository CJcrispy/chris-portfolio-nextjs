      paragraph1: "I have spent the last 12 years in the fire service working as a professional firefighter/paramedic. I have always had a knack for technology and working with computers. In 2019 I started working with HTML and CSS to make some minor edits on a small business website that I was operating. What I thought was just a few small edits turned into a love for programming.",
      paragraph2: "Fascinated with how intricate programming can be I was quickly drawn to learn more. I started learning javascript and was even more enthused with making websites interactive. I then started freelancing for e-commerce companies on the Shopify platform. I am now spending my time building projects with React JS, Firebase, and learning new technologies.",

        `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew bootstrap, you were cool.`,

I've been coding in React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, Express, Fastify, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, C++, C#, Rust, Haskell, Perl, PHP, Assembly, Logo and YouDontKnowShit programming language etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.`,
